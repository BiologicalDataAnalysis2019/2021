# Final Project
# Due Dec. 9 at class time


Much easier on this one:

+ Write a tutorial for your R Package
  + The R package must be installable by other members of the class and installation instructions must be included in the tutorial
  + If data are required for your tutorial, instructions to download the data must be included
  + An example of each function must be included
  + Tutorial must be in RMarkdown format
  + Tutorial should explain what the function does, and why this is a useful good, or interesting thing to do

+ Render the tutorial and upload it to the package website (instructions for this will be given in class 12-2-21)

+ During class:
  + Make a good faith effort to follow along with other's tutorials
