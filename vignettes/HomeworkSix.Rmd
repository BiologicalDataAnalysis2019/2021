# Plotting and choices

## 10 points, due Nov. 5 at 5 PM

For your final project in this class, you will be making an R Package. It will consist of 3 functions that do the following:

+ One to clean up data, such as removing NAs or renaming columns
+ One to plot data
+ One of some sort of statistical test

(Master's and H-Option students see below)

You may work with any of the data sets we've worked with this semester, the ants, the surveys, NOAA/GBIF. Your choice.

# For this week:

Make three .R files in your R_package_Lastname folder. Title each one with what it will do. For example, if your function will make a histogram, title it "HistogramPlot.R" or something. 

Choose the dataset you'd like to work with. Place it in the data directory.

Add, commit, and push the three functions and the data to GitHub.
