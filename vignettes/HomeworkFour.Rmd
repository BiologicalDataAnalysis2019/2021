## Grad Students

Goal setting time! Ideally, each function you write should be in a .R file in your R directory. In your personal project directory (i.e., the one we made in class with your last name Wednesday), please make three .R files. Title each with the name of the function you will write.
Ideally, these functions will do something that you need done for your dissertation. 
Begin the documentation for each by writing the first documentation line - the line that is a one-sentence summary of what the function does. I'm going to take a look through these and make sure we're covering the right material for you to get your work done.
